        <p class="kerala"> Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the
            most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National
            Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters.
            Kerala's beaches, backwaters, lakes, mountain ranges, waterfalls, ancient ports, palaces, religious
            institutions and wildlife sanctuaries are major attractions for both domestic and international
            tourists.

        <p class="Kerala"> The city of Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourists in
            Kerala. Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination compared to other states in
            the country.] In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism an important industry and it was the first
            state in India to do so. Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, the
            government agency that oversees the tourism prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the tourism
            industry. Many advertisements branded Kerala with the tagline Kerala, God's Own Country. Kerala
            tourism is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest recall. In 2006, Kerala
            attracted 8.5 million tourists, an increase of 23.68% over the previous year, making the state one of the
            fastest-growing popular destinations in the world. In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million
            mark.
